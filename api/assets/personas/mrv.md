Hi everyone! I'm mr.V

CS @ UW Seattle
Won at DubHacks (Pacific Northwest's biggest hackathon)
2x Published AI Healthcare Research in peer-reviewed journals
Current Agentic AI Researcher @ UW
Previously worked at Stanford Research Labs
Incoming SWE intern @ PayPal
Looking for teammates who are collaborative, cracked, and serious about competing, not just participating
Built several AI-healthcare/accessibility systems, but am down to explore new fields
Will grind whatever needs grinding (backend, model tuning, debugging at 3am)
I live in the bay close to Stanford, so am down to lend a place to sleep if needed LOL
Will pitch the HELL out of our product and make judges wish they funded us yesterday
